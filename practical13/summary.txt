The length and subcellular localisation	of the human SOD2 protein:
    222 amino aicds and localised in the mitochondrion matrix

The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST	results:
    from 58.1 to 100%

The alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids for each of the three comparisons that you perform using Python:
    The alignment score between human and mouse SOD2 sequences is: 1097.0, and the percentage of identical amino acids is: 90.09009009009009%
    The alignment score between human SOD2 sequence and random sequence is: -216.0, and the percentage of identical amino acids is: 4.954954954954955%
    The alignment score between mouse SOD2 sequence and random sequence is: -195.0, and the percentage of identical amino acids is: 5.8558558558558556%

According to the results, the human SOD2 protein sequence and the mouse SOD2 sequence are most closely related.
