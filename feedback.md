According to the feedback in formative assessment, I correct the practical 3 - 5.

Practical 3:

change the repository name from "Practical3" to "Dianyu-Lai.github.io", so the website can be found in "Dianyu-Lai.github.io"
also add a file named "Reflection", and put it into the right place.

Practical 4:

change the comment of the mystery code. 
the random.randint(1,6) refers to randomly choose a integer within {1,2,3,4,5,6} with equal probability

Practical 5:

100% and I add some comments, change the arrangements of the codes (and also comments) to make it more beautiful.
