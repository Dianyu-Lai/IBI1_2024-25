This week reflection was the hardest one I think.
We used many new function and thoughts to finish the SIR (especially spatial SIR)
it was hard but I think it is also interesting
I am happy with the week practical.
The operation like initialise a new array to avoid over-infection is very novel I think, but also useful.
wish i can play happily with Python
