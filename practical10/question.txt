i am curious about the correlation between country income and DALYs.
from the data frame, i choose World Bank Low Income data and World Bank High Income data for comparsion.
i will plot the line graph containing the two country types with the x-axis years and y-axis DALYs
i expect to find higher income level countries have lower DALYs.

code line 28-37

Discussion: a significant difference in DALYs between low and high income countries can be observed from the plot.
The plot shows that the DALYs of low income countries are generally lower than those of high income countries.
However, there are some countries with very high DALYs in both groups, like China and India,
which may be due to the fact that these countries have a large number of low income individuals.
Therefore, it is important to consider the specific country when interpreting the results.
